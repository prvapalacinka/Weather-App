# Weather-App

This weather app features a search bar for the city and a submit button that will display results for certain weather-related variables such as humidity, UV Index, wind speed, temperature and more data to the user. 
The previous search history is saved in local storage for the user and displayed within the "Search history:" box on the left-hand side of the application. The users previously searched cities will populate and their information may be accessed through a single click over the corresponding name. 

Screenshot of the application has been attached to the files within this REPO.
